# paperman-windows

Modified version of sjg2o's Paperman QT C++ for Linux https://github.com/sjg20/paperman

This one is compiled with MinGW on MSYS, a Linux-like environment for building on Windows, to work on Windows using windows libraries instead. It usees QT5 C++. There are also some added features:
- Buttons to quickly separate or delete the first page of a PDF file.
- Undo/Redo improved to include more steps.
- Quick merging by dropping files on each other.
- Rotating single pages in the side preview menu.

The software is packaged into a single .exe file for easy installation. No additional libraries need to be installed.
